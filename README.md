# Recipe Organizer

Recipe Organizer is a web application that allows users to manage their favorite recipes in a clean and organized interface. The app is a project based on instructions in my Web Development and Internet Applications Program at Fanshawe College, in the Web Development Trends Course.

## Features

- **View Recipes:** Browse a list of pre-defined recipes.
- **Add New Recipes:** Easily add new recipes with details like name, meal type, ingredients, and instructions.
- **Edit & Delete:** Update or remove recipes as needed.
- **Favorites:** Mark recipes as favorites for quick access.
- **Chatbot Assistance:** AI chatbot integration.

Note: For now, the chat box personalized response related to the app is with the prompt:
_what can i do with this app?_
